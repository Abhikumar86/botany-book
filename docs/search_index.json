If one were to make a list of biomolecules, such a list would have thousands of organic compounds including amino acids, sugars, etc. We can call these biomolecules, metabolites. In animal tissues, one notices the presence of all such categories of compounds e.g., proteins, carbohydrates, fats, amino acids and nucleic acids. These are called primary metabolites. However, when one analyses plant, fungal and microbial cells, one would see thousands of compounds other than these primary metabolites e.g., alkaloids, flavonoids, rubber, essential oils, antibiotics, coloured pigments, scents, gums, spices, etc. These are called secondary metabolites (Table 2.1). While primary metabolites have identifiable functions and play known roles in normal physiological processes, many secondary metabolites are useful to human welfare (e.g., rubber, drugs, spices, scents and pigments). Some secondary metabolites have ecological importance. Table 2.1: Some Secondary Metabolites Secondary Metabolites Examples Pigments Carotenoids, Anthocyanins Alkaloids Morphine, Codeine Terpenoids Monoterpenes, Diterpenes Essential oils Lemon grass oil Toxins Abrin, Ricin Lectins Concanavalin Polymeric substances Rubber, Gums, Cellulose Drugs Vinblastine, curcumin In both the cells and extra-cellular fluids dibasic phosphate (HPO42-) and monobasic phosphate (H2PO4) neutralise strong acids and bases respectively. So, they act as acid-base buffers to maintain the H+ ion concentration (pH) of cellular fluids. All the macromolecules except lipids are formed by the process of polymerisation, a process in which repeating sub-units termed monomers are bound into chains of different length (Polymers) e.g., Raffinose is trisaccharide formed by polymerisation of glucose, fructose and galactose. 2.1 Carbohydrates Carbohydrates are so called because in most of them, the proportion of hydrogen and oxygen is the same as in water (H2O) and the general formula may be written as CnH2nOn. Carbohydrates also possess more than one alcoholic (-OH) group. * Carbohydrates are the most abundant organic molecules in nature. * They are the primary energy-storage molecules in most living organisms. * Carbohydrate polymers also called glycans. * Complex carbohydrate polymers covalently attached to proteins or lipids called glycoconjugates. * The carbohydrates can be classified according to the number of sugar subunits they contain. * Monosaccharides: simple sugars, consist of a single polyhydroxy aldehyde or ketone unit * Oligosaccharides: Oligosaccharides consist of short chains of monosaccharide units, or residues, joined by characteristic linkages called glycosidic bonds. * Polysaccharides: sugar polymers containing more than 20 or so monosaccharide units; some have hundreds or thousands of units. 2.1.1 Monosaccharides The simplest carbohydrates, which have the general formula CnH2nOn. These cannot be hydrolysed into still smaller carbohydrates. Monosaccharides are composed of 3 to 7 carbon atoms. They are classified according to the number of carbon atoms, as trioses (C3H6O3), tetroses (C4H8O4), pentoses (C5H10O5), hexoses (C6H12O6) and heptoses (C7H14O7) in that order. Monosaccharides are colourless, crystalline solids that are freely soluble in water but insoluble in nonpolar solvents. Hexoses and pentoses exist in both open chain and ring forms. * Glucose, fructose and galactose are hexoses. They are all white, crystalline, sweet-tasting substances, extremely soluble in water. * Ribose is a pentose and glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone are trioses. These compounds have very important roles to play in the metabolism of cells as you will learn later. * Glucose is the most important sugar occurring in animals. * Fructose is the commonest form of sugar in fruits. Fructose is the sweetest among naturally occurring sugars. * Deoxyribose which occurs in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a pentose. The most abundant monosaccharide in nature is the six-carbon sugar D-glucose, sometimes referred to as dextrose. Monosaccharides have two important chemical properties. Sugars having a free aldehyde or ketone group can reduce Cu++ to Cu+. These are called reducing sugars. This property is the basis for Benedicts test and Fehlings test to detect the presence of glucose in urine. The aldehyde or ketone group of monosaccharide can react and bind with an alcoholic group of another organic compound to join the two compounds together. This bond is called the glycosidic bond. This bond can be hydrolysed to give the original compounds. Monosaccharides by joining together through glycosidic bonds give rise to compound carbohydrates. The latter can be hydrolysed into th e component monosaccharides by water or enzyme. Compound carbohydrates can be classified. into two major groups, oligosaccharides made of a few molecules of monosaccharides (2 to 9) and polysaccharides composed of hundreds of simple sugar molecules (more than 9). Disaccharides: (two sugars) contain two sugar subunits linked covalently. Familiar examples are sucrose (table sugar), maltose (malt sugar), and lactose (milk sugar). Disaccharides are composed of two monosaccharides. A molecule of sucrose is formed from a molecule of glucose and one of fructose Sucrose does not reduce Cu++ to Cu+. It is also the storage product of photo-synthesis in sugarcane and sugarbeet. Lactose or milk sugar is found in human milk and cows milk. It is formed of one molecule of glucose and one of galactose. Maltose or malt sugar is formed from two molecules of glucose during germination of starchy seeds. Maltose and lactose are reducing disaccharides. Oligosaccharides: Polysaccharides: Cellulose and starch are polysaccharides (many sugars), which contain many sugar subunits linked together. Macromolecules (large molecules), such as polysaccharides, that are made up of similar or identical small subunits are known as polymers (many parts). The individual subunits of polymers are called monomers (single parts); polymerization is the stepwise linking of monomers into polymers. 2.1.2 Oligo "],["methods.html", "Chapter 3 Methods", " Chapter 3 Methods We describe our methods in this chapter.

Life is recognised by mode of its working which includes some unified and basic characteristics. The important characteristics are: Growth: All living beings grow. Increase in mass and increase in number of cells are twin characters of growth. In unicellular organisms, it can be increase in size and mass, whereas in multicellular, it is increase in the number of cells. The growth takes place by cell division. In plants, the growth by cell division occurs continuously throughout their life span and therefore, is indefinite, whereas in animals this growth is seen only up to a certain age and hence it is definite. Non-living objects also grow if we take increase in body mass as a criterion of growth. Growth therefore, cannot be taken as a defining property of living organisms. Reproduction: The reproduction means to produce progeny possessing features more or less similar to those of the parents. The organisms can reproduce asexually as well as sexually. There are different methods of asexual reproduction in different forms of organisms. Reproduction is synonymous with growth in unicellular organisms i.e., increase in the number of cells is equivalent to reproduction. Further, there are some organisms which do not reproduce at all e.g., Worker bees, mules. Hence, reproduction also cannot be an all-inclusive property of living organisms. Metabolism: All living beings show metabolism. It is defined as sum total of all chemical reactions taking place in the body of an organism. Some of the chemical reactions are constructive and are called as anabolic, whereas others are destructive and are called as catabolic. If anabolism exceeds catabolism, growth takes place. Irritability: All living beings respond to the external stimuli. The response given by an organism to the stimulus is called as Irritability. It Is because of presence of either nervous system or some sensory structures in different forms of life. Thus, consciousness is defining property 7.2 Systematics and Taxonomy 7.2.1 Diversity of Life The variety of living organisms on Earth, including plants, animals, bacteria, and fungi, is enormous (Mora et al. 2011). Predicted number of total species on earth is 5 to 50 million. Average number is 14 million. It is estimated that there are perhaps 10 million eukaryotic species and an unknown number of prokaryotic ones (Mora et al. 2011). According to Catalogue of Life Number of taxonomically known species is over 1.83 million. These include nearly 1.2 million animals and over 0.5 million species of plants. Amongst animals, insects form the largest group i.e., over 10,25,000 species. Every year known or discovered number of species is 15,000. 7.2.2 Need of Classification Keeping in view vast diversity of living organism, there is a need to classify organisms. Gives an idea about diversity of organisms Throws light into the origin of organisms Gives information about evolutionary Interrelations between organisms By studying one member of a group, a broad idea regarding all organisms of the group can be obtained 7.2.3 Systematics The scientific study of this biological diversity and its evolutionary history is called systematics. Figure 7.1: Carl Linnaeus, A. P. de Candolle and C. Bauhin (left to right) Term given by Carolus Linnaeus (Figure 7.1) Study of diversity of organisms and their comparative and evolutionary relationship. Systematics = Taxonomy + Phylogeny Phylogeny is the evolutionary history of organisms Most of the taxonomist believed that both taxonomy and systematics are interchangeable, but G. Simpson considered these as separate fields. 7.2.4 Taxonomy Term by A. P. de Candolle (Figure 7.1)  in his book Theorie Elementaire de la Botanique. Study of principles and procedures of classification of organisms Components of taxonomy are Characterisation, Identification, Nomenclature and Classification Identification is the first step of taxonomy, and is based upon characterisation 7.2.5 Taxonomic Hierarchy The placement of organisms to different ranks in a systematic framework of classification. This framework is called taxonomic hierarchy. First given by Linnaeus who introduced 5 ranks i.e., Class  order  genus  species  variety (from upper to lower) Later on, modified with 7 obligate categories and about 21 intermediate categories. Seven obligate categories are: KingdomPhylum/DivisionClassOrderFamilyGenusSpecies (from higher to lower) DomainKingdomPhylum/DivisionClassOrderFamilyGenusSpecies [ICFRE 2020] Higher the category; higher the number of organisms and lesser the number of common characters. Intermediate categories are written with prefix super and sub, e.g., superclass; subclass. Intraspecies categories (Intermediate categories) Sub-species/varietiessubvarietyform/racesubform or clone Table 7.1: Terms and their Authors term (s) Author Phylum Cuvier Division Eichler Class, Order Linnaeus Family, Species John Ray Genus Toumefort Concept of Genus Brunfels Taxon is a taxonomic group of real organisms assigned to a category. Category represents rank/level in a hierarchy 7.3 Species Concept and Types 7.3.1 Species Concept Species concepts (De Queiroz 2007) Morphological/Static/Typological Concept: By Linnaeus; Species are fixed, Immutable and can be recognised by their morphological features. Dynamic Concept of Species: By Lamarck; Mutable and Changeable Biological Concept of Species: By Ernst Mayr; Based on reproductive Isolation. K. Jordan (1905) first gave the definition, Later Mayr proposed the biological species concept. According to this concept, a species is a group of interbreeding natural population that is reproductively isolated from other such groups. Exceptions of Biological Concept of Species / Reproductive isolation: Table 7.2: Exceptions to Biological Concept of Species Hybridisation Reproductive Potential  Donkey ×  Horse = Mule Sterile hybrids (under natural conditions)  Horse ×  Donkey = Hinny Sterile hybrids (under natural conditions)  Tiger ×  Lion = Tigon Fertile hybrids (under captive conditions)  Lion ×  Tiger = Liger Fertile hybrids (under captive conditions) Evolutionary Species Concept: Simpson (1961) has proposed that an evolutionary species is a lineage (an ancestral- descendant sequence of populations) evolving separately from others and with its own unitary evolutionary role and tendencies. Christoffersen (1995) proposed the ontological species concept that is a species is a single lineage of ancestral descendant sexual populations genetically integrated by historically contingent events of interbreeding. This definition of Christoffersen has given stress on the interbreeding nature of a species. 7.3.2 Species Types Table 7.3: Major types of Species Species Type Description Morphospecies Species erected on the basis of morphological characters Taxonomic species Species with binomial name Sibling species Two different species which are morphologically identical but do not interbreed Allopatric species Species having, exclusive area of geographical distribution Sympatric species Species having overlapping areas of geographical distribution Parapatric species Species found in narrow overlapping zone Allochronic species Species belonging to different time period Synchronic species Species belonging to same time period 7.4 Nomenclature Vernacular names are the names given in local language, which varies from place to place and language to language. Thus, these names are not universal. On the other hand, Scientific names give a universal name to a particular organism on the basis of definite rules and criteria. Polynomial nomenclature: Introduced before 1750, organisms name consists of a series of latinised descriptive words. Such names became lengthy and difficult to learn. e.g., Caryophyllum saxatilis folis gramineus umbellatis corymbis. For example, for catnip, which was formally named Nepeta floribus interrupte spicatus pedunculatis (meaning Nepeta with flowers in an interrupted pedunculate spike). Binomial nomenclature: First proposed by Gaspard Bauhin (or Caspar Bauhin) in Pinax Theatri Botanici (1623) Introduced by Carolus Linnaeus; Swedish naturalist who changed his name according to binomial nomenclature. His old name was Karl Von Linne. Organisms name consists of two Latin words. First name is generic and second name is species epithet. e.g., Garden pea  Pisum sativum (L). Letter in bracket shows the name of scientist who gave the name. Binomial epithet = genus + species + authors citation Linnaeus gave some principles of the binomial nomenclature in Philosophia Botanica, But the nomenclature was use first in Species Plantarum, where names and description of 5,900 species of plants were given. Later he published Systema Naturae, where 4,326 species of a were described. Trinomial nomenclature: Given by Lamarck, it consists of 3 words i.e., genus + species + sub-species or varieties (Table 7.1). In animal kingdom - third name is subspecies whereas in plantae - it is varieties. Table 7.1: Examples of Trinomial Nomenclature Vernacular Name Scientific Name Indian crow Corvus splendens splendens Srilankan crow Corvus splendens protegatus Bunnese crow Corvus splendens insolens Cabbage Brassica oleracea capitata 7.4.1 Standardisation of Names ICBN (1961): International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (Earlier) ICNafp (2018): International Code of Nomenclature for Algae, Fungi, and Plants [ICFRE 2020; CGPSC 2020] ICZN (1964): International Code of Zoological Nomenclature ICNB: International Code for Nomenclature of Bacteria ICNCP: International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants ICTV: International Committee for the Taxonomy of Virus 7.4.2 Terminology Tautonyms: An organism with same generic and species name. It is not applicable in plants. e.g., Rattus rattus. Autonyms: When species and subspecies names are same. e.g., Corvus splendens splendens. Synonyms: When two or more names are given, the first name is recognised as valid name and all other names are called synonyms. e.g., Albugo candida (valid name); Cystopus candidus (synonym). Homonyms: One name for two different plants. e.g., Prunus dulsi (almond and plum). 7.4.3 Nomenclatural Types Table 7.4: Nomenclatural Types Type Description Holotype Nomenclature type Isotype Duplicate of holotype Paratype Any other specimen described along with holotype Syntype Any one of the two or more specimens cited by author when there is no holotype Lectotype Specimen selected from original material to serve as nomenclature type where there is no holotype (missing) Neotype New nomenclature type when the original material is missing Topotype It is name given to a specimen collected from the same locality from which the holotype was originally collected 7.5 Taxonomic Literature According to Porter (1967) Taxonomic literature runs the gamut from ponderous volumes to obscure notes in periodicals and even letters of correspondence between workers. Classics: The works which have been profoundly influenced the development of plant taxonomy and regarded as landmarks in the history of Botany are called Classics. They include the works of Theophrastus, Pliny, Dioscorides, Albertus Magnus, Brunfels, Cesalpino, the Bauhins, Ray, Tournefort and Linnaeus. Taxonomic Indexes: The taxonomic indexes are indexes of plant names and not to literature concerning the plants. Indexes serve as an aid to locating quickly the source of original publication of a name, to learn if a particular name has been applied to a plant or to what order, family, subfamily or tribe, a plant of a given name may belong. These indexes are the nucleus of any significant taxonomic library, and it is incumbent on the student of taxonomy to know of their availability and importance. Important taxonomic indices are: Index Nominum Genericorum (ING): A compilation of generic names published for organisms covered by the ICN: International Code of Nomenclature for Algae, Fungi, and Plants. It is the list of all generic names of plants of all groups (Fossil and Recent). It was published by E.R. Far, J. A. Leussinke and F. A. Stfleu in 1979 in 3 volumes. It included all generic names from 1753 to 1975. Index Kewensis Plantarum Phanerogamarun (IK): Generally called Index Kewensis (IK). It is the most comprehensive list of scientific names of seed plants (Gymnosperms and Angiosperms). The first 2 volumes were compiled by J.D. Hooker and B.D. Jackson in 1893-1895 at Kew. It includes generic names in alphabetical order between 1753-1885. International Plant Name Index (IPNI): Index Herbariorum: It is a guide to the location and contents of the worlds public herbaria. Floras: A flora is a systematic arrangement of the species of a given area or a particular region, usually restricted to a major segment of the plant kingdom (flowering plants etc.), with keys and descriptions and often illustrations, by the use of which a student may determine the names and characteristics of the wild plants of the area. In any flora the plants are arranged according to one or another of the available systems (Engler, Bessey, Hutchinson, etc.), giving for each plant the complete scientific name, author citation, reference to source of original publication, synonymy, and geographic distribution within the area in question. Monographs and Revisions: A monograph is a treatise including all significant information of a morphologic or taxonomic nature covering the group such as family or genus. A taxonomic monograph is a comprehensive treatise representing an analysis and synthesis of existing taxonomic knowledge of that taxon, plus the results of original research of that in systematics. In other words, it is as complete an account as can be made at a given time of any one family, tribe, or genus, nothing being neglected which is necessary for a perfect knowledge of it. A taxonomic revision differs from a monograph primarily in degree of scope and completeness. Often it accounts for only a section of a genus or for the elements as restricted to a continent or smaller geographical area. Many revisions make no attempt to review all previous work on the taxon or to take cognizance of the interrelated sciences of cytotaxonomy, genetics, ecology, etc. A revision may be based only on herbarium studies, where as monograph should cover the morphology, anatomy, cytology, genetics and ecology. Catalogues: Catalogues account for the books of special libraries rich in botanical titles, and are of especial value in taxonomic studies. It is often necessary to know the full name of a particular author, to know the unabridged and exact title of a work, to know when it was published, or when a particular edition was issued. These data are usually available from such catalogues. Review Serials: Review serials are periodicals, usually issued at regular intervals, that provide either: A bibliography of current literature of a particular subject, An abstract of papers or books in special fields, Reviews of titles of current literature, or Any combination of these functions. Periodical: A periodical, is a publication appearing usually at regular intervals. Each issue is called a number, or sometimes is termed a fascicle. Collectively these numbers or fascicles comprise a volume. In the case of periodicals appearing at regular intervals  biweekly, monthly, or quarterly- a volume usually comprises the issues of a calendar year. Dictionaries and Glossaries: Dictionaries and glossaries from the nucleus of taxonomic literature. Dictionaries and glossaries are invaluable in a subject matter with so large a vocabulary as that of Botany. A botanical dictionary may list and describe all known genera of certain plant groups e.g. A Dictionary of Flowering, Plants and Ferns by J. C. Willis. A glossary is an alphabetical list of difficult terms with their interpretations. 7.5.1 Important Contributions of Linnaeus Father of Taxonomy Binomial Nomenclature Artificial System of Classification Species Plantarum (1753): It was published in 2 volumes. First in May 1753 and second in August 1753. classification of 5,900 plants It does not provide generic description. Binomial system of nomenclature adopted in it for the first time. starting point for ICNafp [ICFRE 2020]. It accepted the rule of priority in the nomenclature of flowering plants and pteridophytes.

The Genera of Flowering Plants: It was published by J. Hutchinson is 2 volumes in 1964 and 1967; dealing with dicotyledonous plants. It is based on Genera Plantarum by Bentham and Hooker. Indian Publications: Flora of British India: J. D. Hooker Hortus Indicus Malabaricus (1678-1703): Published in 12 parts containing the account of 794 plants of Malabar region. It is Pre-linnean publication and first authentic record of plants. Wallichian catalogue (1828-1829): It is a list of 9,148 plants collected during Naithaniel Wallichis suprintendence of Royal Botanic Garden, Calcutta. Many new plant names proposed in this work are nomen-nudum, i.e., species names without description and contrary to rules of nomenclature. Botanical Survey of India published the Roxburgh Icones (1829) in small fascicles in 1964; Wights Icons contain 201 plates in 6 volumes. 7.6 Taxonomical Aids Herbarium: It is defined as a store house of collected plant specimens that are dried, pressed and preserved on sheets. These sheets are arranged in the sequence of an accepted classification system. Preservation of plants is done by drying and pressing technique. Steps of herbarium technique: Collection  Drying  Poisoning  Mounting  Stitching  Labelling  Deposition The collections are kept inside metallic vasculum or polythene bags. Poisoning is done by using 0.1% HgCl2 The international size of herbarium sheet is 41 × 29 cm Primary function of herbarium is accurate identification and -taxonomic research Greatest herbarium of world is herbarium of Royal Botanical Garden, Kew, England having more than 6 million specimens [CGPSC 2020] Largest herbarium of India  Central National Herbarium, Kolkata  20 lakh (2 million) specimens Herbarium making art was started by Caesalpino et. al. Taxonomic Keys: The scheme for identification of plants and animals is known as a key. These are based on the contrasting characters known as couplet. Each character of couplet is known as lead. Being analytical in nature, these are generally of two types: Indented or Yolked Key: It has sequence of choice between two or more statements of characters of species Bracketed Key: These are most popular keys, the pairs of contrasting characters are given numbers in brackets Botanical Gardens: Provide means of ex-situ conservation strategies and records of local flora for monographic work. Total 525 botanical gardens are established in various countries 125 botanical gardens are known with documented collections of authenticated taxa. The International Association of Botanical Gardens (IABG) was established in 1962. The International Directory of Botanical Gardens was published in 1983. Some Important Botanical Gardens are: Botanical Garden Remarks Royal Botanical Garden, Kew, England Botanical capital of the world; founded by William Aton Orto Botanico, Italy Oldest of world Pisa, Italy Famous for palaeontological study Palermo, Italy Famous for dragon plant Indian Botanical Gardens: Indian Botanical Garden, Kolkata Lloyd Botanical Garden, Darjeeling National Botanical Garden, Lucknow Lalbag Botanical Garden, Bangalore Museums: These have collections of preserved plants and animals for study and reference. These differs from parks because no living object is displayed in museums. E.g., Preservation of succulent plants  in FAA solution (2-5% Formaldehyde: Acetic acid: Alcohol in 5: 5: 90 ratio). Some important Museums: Natural History Museum, London (England) United States National Museum, Washington National Museum of Natural History (NMNH), Delhi Prince of Wales Museum, Mumbai Zoological Parks: Zoos/zoological gardens (parks) are protected areas or enclosed space where live wild animals are kept. Objectives are public exhibition to understand wild life, recreation, education, ex-situ conservation and breeding of rare fauna. National Zoological Park, Delhi is one of the finest zoos of Asia Largest zoo of the world in Kruger (South Africa) References "],["morphology-of-angiosperms.html", "Chapter 8 Morphology of Angiosperms 8.1 Classification 8.2 Roots", " Chapter 8 Morphology of Angiosperms 8.1 Classification On the Basis of Habit: Herbs: Herbs are small plants with soft stems. They may be annual (e.g., Mustard  Brassica campestris), biennial (e.g. Radish  Raphanus sativus), or perennial (e.g., Canna). Shrubs: Shrubs are medium sized perennial woody plants which branch profusely from the base and attain a bushy appearance. e.g., China rose (Hibiscus rosa-sinensis), Capparis decidua. Trees: A tree has a main stout and woody trunk which gives off branches only at some distance above the ground, e.g., mango (Mangifera indica), shisham (Dalbergia sissoo) and banyan (Ficus benghalensis). On the Basis of Life Span: Annuals: The plants which complete their life cycle in a single season or few weeks or few months are called annuals. They grow and produce flowers and fruits within this period and then die off. e.g., mustard (Brassica campestris), pea (Pisum sativum), wheat (Triticum aestivum), maize (Zea mays), Euphorbia prostrata. Biennials: The plants which complete their life cycle in two growing seasons are called biennials. In the first season, they grow vegetatively and in the next season, they produce flowers, fruits and seeds. e g. Carrot (Daucus carota), radish (Raphanus sativus) and turnip (Brassica rapa). Perennials: These are the plants which continues to grow for many years. e.g., peach (Prunus persica) and apple (Pyrus malus). Perennials can be, monocarpic (which flower and fruit only once in life time) e.g., bamboo (Bambusa tulda), century plant (Agave americana), or polycarpic (which flower and fruit many times in life time), e.g., mango, pear. 8.2 Roots 8.2.1 Characters True roots develop from radicle of seed They are non green, underground. positively geotropic and negatively phototropic. Roots usually do not bear buds, but buds are present for vegetative propagation in sweet potato (Ipomoea) and Indian red wood (Dalbergia). They do not bear nodes and inter-nodes. They have unicellular root hair which arise exogenously. Lateral roots arise endogenously i.e., from pericycle. 8.2.2 Parts of Roots Root cap: At the apex of root, a smooth cap shaped structure is present which is called as root cap. It is protective. Multiple root cap is found in aerial roots of screwpine (Pandanus). In hydrophytes, root cap is either absent or replaced by root pocket, e.g., Pistia, Lemna, Eichhornia. Absent in epiphytes, parasites, and mycorrhizal roots. Zone of cell formation or division: The cells of this region are in active state of division and their number increases continuously. No vacuoles or small vacuoles are present. Zone of cell elongation: Maximum growth in the cells occur in this zone. Large central vacuole is present. Zone of cell maturation: The cells in this region are differentiated into permanent tissues depending upon the functions they have to perform. Root hairs are also present in this zone which help in absorption of water. In hydrophytes, root hairs are absent because they absorb water through general body surface. 8.2.3 Types of Roots Tap roots: They develop from radicle. The primary root grows and gives rise to secondary and tertiary roots forming tap root system. e.g., dicots. It is of two types: Racemose or deep feeder tap root system, e.g., Mango, Peepal. Cymose or surface feeder tap root system, e.g., Pinus, Solanum. Adventitious roots: They develop from any part of the plant body other than the radicle. They are call adventitious roots. e.g., monocots. They are usually shallow surface feeders like fibrous roots of grasses. Seminal roots: They develop from coleorhiza, e.g., Maize. 8.2.4 Modifications Modification of tap roots: Storage or fleshy tap roots: They store food and assume various shapes. Fusiform: Spindle shaped, e.g., Radish (Raphanus sativus). Conical: Cone like, e.g., Carrot (Daucus carota). Napiform: Swollen in the upper part and abruptly tapers in lower part, e.g., Turnip (Brassica rapa) and Beet root (Beta vulgaris). Tuberous or tubercular: The roots are thick and fleshy, but do not maintain any particular shape, e.g., Four oclock plant (Mirabilis). Respiratory root or pneumatophores or Aerophores: Some plants like Avicennia, Rhizophora and Sonneratia, which grow in salty marshes, develop special kinds of roots for respiration. These roots are called respiratory roots or pneumatophores. They are conical in shape and arise from the branches of underground tap root and grow vertically upwards (i.e., negatively geotropic) into the air. The upper portions of these roots have numerous aerating pores called pneumathodes or lenticels. [ICFRE 2020] Nodulated roots: Roots of legumes like pea (Pisum sativum), gram (Cicer arietinum), groundnut (Arachis hypogea), soyabean (Glycine max) have nodules which have nitrogen fixing bacteria of the genus Rhizobium. They fix atmospheric nitrogen into nitrates. This is a symbiotic relationship. Modifications of adventitious roots: Storage adventitious roots: Tuberous: Single root arises from node of stem and becomes tuberous and fleshy for storage of food, e.g., Sweet potato (Ipomoea batata). Fasciculated: Roots arise in bunch (cluster) from lower node of stem and become fleshy e.g., Dahlia, Asparagus. Palmate roots: The bases of the swollen fleshy roots become fused. Thus, swollen finger-like fleshy roots arise from a common point as if fingers arising from a palm, e.g., Orchis. Nodulose: Root apex becomes swollen and fleshy, e.g., Mango ginger (Curcuma amanda). Beaded or moniliform: Roots swell at different places forming beaded structure, e.g., Vitis, Bitter gourd (Momordica charantia) and some grasses. Annulated: Roots having series of ring like swellings, e.g., Ipecac (Psychotria). Adventitious roots that provide extra support: Prop roots: They arise from the branches for mechanical support as pillars. e.g., old banyan tree (Ficus benghalensis), both tap and prop roots are found. Stilt roots: They arise from lower nodes of stem and enter the soil obliquely, e.g., Sugarcane, Maize, Screwpine. Climbing roots: They arise from nodes and help the plants in climbing, e.g., Pothos, Piper. Buttress roots: They arise from basal parts of main stem and spread in different directions in the soil, e.g., Bombax, Ficus. Adventitious roots with special function: Respiratory roots: In aquatic plants as Jussiaea, white spongy roots arise from branches and help in respiration. Assimilatory or photosynthetic roots: The aerial roots of Tinospora and submerged roots of Trapa (water chestnut) become green and synthesize food. Sucking roots or haustoria: These roots suck food and water from host and are found in parasitic plants, e.g., Cuscuta. Hygroscopic roots: These are found in epiphytes and help in absorption of moisture from the atmosphere by special tissue called velamen, e.g., Orchids. Clinging roots: These are present in the juvenile stage of Ivy (Hedera helix). They arise from the nodes and inter-nodes, pierce the stem of host plant and attach the plant to the host. Foliar roots or epiphyllous roots or leaf roots: Leaves of Bryophyllum and Bignonia have adventitious roots on the leaf margin. In floating plant Salvinia, one leaf of each node is modified into root for balancing the plant in water. Mycorrhizal roots: Roots of Pinus have symbiotic association with fungus. They do not have root hairs as hyphae act as root hairs. Plants that lack roots, e.g., Wolfia and Utricularia. These plants require less water and minerals. Plants that are all roots, e.g., Podostemon.
