"],["biomolecules.html", "Chapter 2 Biomolecules 2.1 Carbohydrates", " Chapter 2 Biomolecules The most exciting aspect of chemistry deal with isolating thousands of compounds, small and big, from living organisms, determining their structure and if possible, synthesizing them. If one were to make a list of biomolecules, such a list would have thousands of organic compounds including amino acids, sugars, etc. We can call these biomolecules, metabolites. In animal tissues, one notices the presence of all such categories of compounds e.g., proteins, carbohydrates, fats, amino acids and nucleic acids. These are called primary metabolites. However, when one analyses plant, fungal and microbial cells, one would see thousands of compounds other than these primary metabolites e.g., alkaloids, flavonoids, rubber, essential oils, antibiotics, coloured pigments, scents, gums, spices, etc. These are called secondary metabolites (Table 2.1). While primary metabolites have identifiable functions and play known roles in normal physiological processes, many secondary metabolites are useful to human welfare (e.g., rubber, drugs, spices, scents and pigments). Some secondary metabolites have ecological importance. Table 2.1: Some Secondary Metabolites Secondary Metabolites Examples Pigments Carotenoids, Anthocyanins, etc. Alkaloids Morphine, Codeine, etc. Terpenoids Monoterpenes, Diterpenes, etc. Essential oils Lemon grass oil, etc. Toxins Abrin, Ricin Lectins Concanavalin Polymeric substances Rubber, Gums, Cellulose Drugs Vinblastine, curcumin, etc. In both the cells and extra-cellular fluids dibasic phosphate (HPO42-) and monobasic phosphate (H2PO4) neutralise strong acids and bases respectively. So, they act as acid-base buffers to maintain the H+ ion concentration (pH) of cellular fluids. All the macromolecules except lipids are formed by the process of polymerisation, a process in which repeating sub-units termed monomers are bound into chains of different length (Polymers) e.g., Raffinose is trisaccharide formed by polymerisation of glucose, fructose and galactose. 2.1 Carbohydrates Carbohydrates are so called because in most of them, the proportion of hydrogen and oxygen is the same as in water (H2O) and the general formula may be written as CnH2nOn. Carbohydrates also possess more than one alcoholic (OH) group. Carbohydrates are known as saccharides or compounds containing sugar. The simplest carbohydrates are the simple sugars or monosaccharides, many of which have the general formula CnH2nOn. These cannot be hydrolysed into still smaller carbohydrates. Monosaccharides are composed of 3 to 7 carbon atoms. They are classified according to the number of carbon atoms, as trioses (C3H6O3), tetroses (C4H8O4), pentoses (C5H10O5), hexoses (C6H12O6) and heptoses (C7H14O7) in that order. Hexoses and pentoses exist in both open chain and ring forms. Glucose, fructose and galactose are hexoses. They are all white, crystalline, sweet-tasting substances, extremely soluble in water. Ribose is a pentose and glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone are trioses. These compounds have very important roles to play in the metabolism of cells as you will learn later. Glucose is the most important sugar occurring in animals. Fructose is the commonest form of sugar in fruits. Deoxyribose which occurs in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a pentose.

Life is recognised by mode of its working which includes some unified and basic characteristics. The important characteristics are: Growth: All living beings grow. Increase in mass and increase in number of cells are twin characters of growth. In unicellular organisms, it can be increase in size and mass, whereas in multicellular, it is increase in the number of cells. The growth takes place by cell division. In plants, the growth by cell division occurs continuously throughout their life span and therefore, is indefinite, whereas in animals this growth is seen only up to a certain age and hence it is definite. Non-living objects also grow if we take increase in body mass as a criterion of growth. Growth therefore, cannot be taken as a defining property of living organisms. Reproduction: The reproduction means to produce progeny possessing features more or less similar to those of the parents. The organisms can reproduce asexually as well as sexually. There are different methods of asexual reproduction in different forms of organisms. Reproduction is synonymous with growth in unicellular organisms i.e., increase in the number of cells is equivalent to reproduction. Further, there are some organisms which do not reproduce at all e.g., Worker bees, mules. Hence, reproduction also cannot be an all-inclusive property of living organisms. Metabolism: All living beings show metabolism. It is defined as sum total of all chemical reactions taking place in the body of an organism. Some of the chemical reactions are constructive and are called as anabolic, whereas others are destructive and are called as catabolic. If anabolism exceeds catabolism, growth takes place. Irritability: All living beings respond to the external stimuli. The response given by an organism to the stimulus is called as Irritability. It Is because of presence of either nervous system or some sensory structures in different forms of life. Thus, consciousness is defining property 6.2 Systematics and Taxonomy 6.2.1 Diversity of Life The variety of living organisms on Earth, including plants, animals, bacteria, and fungi, is enormous (Mora et al. 2011). Predicted number of total species on earth is 5 to 50 million. Average number is 14 million. It is estimated that there are perhaps 10 million eukaryotic species and an unknown number of prokaryotic ones (Mora et al. 2011). According to Catalogue of Life Number of taxonomically known species is over 1.83 million. These include nearly 1.2 million animals and over 0.5 million species of plants. Amongst animals, insects form the largest group i.e., over 10,25,000 species. Every year known or discovered number of species is 15,000. 6.2.2 Need of Classification Keeping in view vast diversity of living organism, there is a need to classify organisms. Gives an idea about diversity of organisms Throws light into the origin of organisms Gives information about evolutionary Interrelations between organisms By studying one member of a group, a broad idea regarding all organisms of the group can be obtained 6.2.3 Systematics The scientific study of this biological diversity and its evolutionary history is called systematics. Figure 6.1: Carl Linnaeus, A. P. de Candolle and C. Bauhin (left to right) Term given by Carolus Linnaeus (Figure 6.1) Study of diversity of organisms and their comparative and evolutionary relationship. Systematics = Taxonomy + Phylogeny Phylogeny is the evolutionary history of organisms Most of the taxonomist believed that both taxonomy and systematics are interchangeable, but G. Simpson considered these as separate fields. 6.2.4 Taxonomy Term by A. P. de Candolle (Figure 6.1)  in his book Theorie Elementaire de la Botanique. Study of principles and procedures of classification of organisms Components of taxonomy are Characterisation, Identification, Nomenclature and Classification Identification is the first step of taxonomy, and is based upon characterisation 6.2.5 Taxonomic Hierarchy The placement of organisms to different ranks in a systematic framework of classification. This framework is called taxonomic hierarchy. First given by Linnaeus who introduced 5 ranks i.e., Class  order  genus  species  variety (from upper to lower) Later on, modified with 7 obligate categories and about 21 intermediate categories. Seven obligate categories are: KingdomPhylum/DivisionClassOrderFamilyGenusSpecies (from higher to lower) DomainKingdomPhylum/DivisionClassOrderFamilyGenusSpecies [ICFRE 2020] Higher the category; higher the number of organisms and lesser the number of common characters. Intermediate categories are written with prefix super and sub, e.g., superclass; subclass. Intraspecies categories (Intermediate categories) Sub-species/varietiessubvarietyform/racesubform or clone Table 6.1: Terms and their Authors Term (s) Author Phylum Cuvier Division Eichler Class, Order Linnaeus Family, Species John Ray Genus Toumefort Concept of Genus Brunfels Taxon is a taxonomic group of real organisms assigned to a category. Category represents rank/level in a hierarchy 6.3 Species Concept and Types 6.3.1 Species Concept Species concepts (De Queiroz 2007) Morphological/Static/Typological Concept: By Linnaeus; Species are fixed, Immutable and can be recognised by their morphological features. Dynamic Concept of Species: By Lamarck; Mutable and Changeable Biological Concept of Species: By Ernst Mayr; Based on reproductive Isolation. K. Jordan (1905) first gave the definition, Later Mayr proposed the biological species concept. According to this concept, a species is a group of interbreeding natural population that is reproductively isolated from other such groups. Exceptions of Biological Concept of Species / Reproductive isolation: Table 6.2: Exceptions to Biological Concept of Species Hybridisation Reproductive Potential  Donkey ×  Horse = Mule Sterile hybrids (under natural conditions)  Horse ×  Donkey = Hinny Sterile hybrids (under natural conditions)  Tiger ×  Lion = Tigon Fertile hybrids (under captive conditions)  Lion ×  Tiger = Liger Fertile hybrids (under captive conditions) Evolutionary Species Concept: Simpson (1961) has proposed that an evolutionary species is a lineage (an ancestral- descendant sequence of populations) evolving separately from others and with its own unitary evolutionary role and tendencies. Christoffersen (1995) proposed the ontological species concept that is a species is a single lineage of ancestral descendant sexual populations genetically integrated by historically contingent events of interbreeding. This definition of Christoffersen has given stress on the interbreeding nature of a species. 6.3.2 Species Types Table 6.3: Major types of Species Species Type Description Morphospecies Species erected on the basis of morphological characters Taxonomic species Species with binomial name Sibling species Two different species which are morphologically identical but do not interbreed Allopatric species Species having, exclusive area of geographical distribution Sympatric species Species having overlapping areas of geographical distribution Parapatric species Species found in narrow overlapping zone Allochronic species Species belonging to different time period Synchronic species Species belonging to same time period 6.4 Nomenclature Vernacular names are the names given in local language, which varies from place to place and language to language. Thus, these names are not universal. On the other hand, Scientific names give a universal name to a particular organism on the basis of definite rules and criteria. Polynomial nomenclature: Introduced before 1750, organisms name consists of a series of latinised descriptive words. Such names became lengthy and difficult to learn. e.g., Caryophyllum saxatilis folis gramineus umbellatis corymbis. For example, for catnip, which was formally named Nepeta floribus interrupte spicatus pedunculatis (meaning Nepeta with flowers in an interrupted pedunculate spike). Binomial nomenclature: First proposed by Gaspard Bauhin (or Caspar Bauhin) in Pinax Theatri Botanici (1623) Introduced by Carolus Linnaeus; Swedish naturalist who changed his name according to binomial nomenclature. His old name was Karl Von Linne. Organisms name consists of two Latin words. First name is generic and second name is species epithet. e.g., Garden pea  Pisum sativum (L). Letter in bracket shows the name of scientist who gave the name. Binomial epithet = genus + species + authors citation Linnaeus gave some principles of the binomial nomenclature in Philosophia Botanica, But the nomenclature was use first in Species Plantarum, where names and description of 5,900 species of plants were given. Later he published Systema Naturae, where 4,326 species of a were described. Trinomial nomenclature: Given by Lamarck, it consists of 3 words i.e., genus + species + sub-species or varieties (Table 6.4). In animal kingdom - third name is subspecies whereas in plantae - it is varieties. Table 6.4: Examples of Trinomial Nomenclature Vernacular Name Scientific Name Indian crow Corvus splendens splendens Srilankan crow Corvus splendens protegatus Bunnese crow Corvus splendens insolens Cabbage Brassica oleracea capitata 6.4.1 Standardisation of Names ICBN (1961): International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (Earlier) ICNafp (2018): International Code of Nomenclature for Algae, Fungi, and Plants [ICFRE 2020; CGPSC 2020] ICZN (1964): International Code of Zoological Nomenclature ICNB: International Code for Nomenclature of Bacteria ICNCP: International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants ICTV: International Committee for the Taxonomy of Virus 6.4.2 Terminology Tautonyms: An organism with same generic and species name. It is not applicable in plants. e.g., Rattus rattus. Autonyms: When species and subspecies names are same. e.g., Corvus splendens splendens. Synonyms: When two or more names are given, the first name is recognised as valid name and all other names are called synonyms. e.g., Albugo candida (valid name); Cystopus candidus (synonym). Homonyms: One name for two different plants. e.g., Prunus dulsi (almond and plum). 6.4.3 Nomenclatural Types Table 6.5: Nomenclatural Types Type Description Holotype Nomenclature type Isotype Duplicate of holotype Paratype Any other specimen described along with holotype Syntype Any one of the two or more specimens cited by author when there is no holotype Lectotype Specimen selected from original material to serve as nomenclature type where there is no holotype (missing) Neotype New nomenclature type when the original material is missing Topotype It is name given to a specimen collected from the same locality from which the holotype was originally collected 6.5 Taxonomic Literature According to Porter (1967) Taxonomic literature runs the gamut from ponderous volumes to obscure notes in periodicals and even letters of correspondence between workers. Classics: The works which have been profoundly influenced the development of plant taxonomy and regarded as landmarks in the history of Botany are called Classics. They include the works of Theophrastus, Pliny, Dioscorides, Albertus Magnus, Brunfels, Cesalpino, the Bauhins, Ray, Tournefort and Linnaeus. Taxonomic Indexes: The taxonomic indexes are indexes of plant names and not to literature concerning the plants. Indexes serve as an aid to locating quickly the source of original publication of a name, to learn if a particular name has been applied to a plant or to what order, family, subfamily or tribe, a plant of a given name may belong. These indexes are the nucleus of any significant taxonomic library, and it is incumbent on the student of taxonomy to know of their availability and importance. Important taxonomic indices are: Index Nominum Genericorum (ING): A compilation of generic names published for organisms covered by the ICN: International Code of Nomenclature for Algae, Fungi, and Plants. It is the list of all generic names of plants of all groups (Fossil and Recent). It was published by E.R. Far, J. A. Leussinke and F. A. Stfleu in 1979 in 3 volumes. It included all generic names from 1753 to 1975. Index Kewensis Plantarum Phanerogamarun (IK): Generally called Index Kewensis (IK). It is the most comprehensive list of scientific names of seed plants (Gymnosperms and Angiosperms). The first 2 volumes were compiled by J.D. Hooker and B.D. Jackson in 1893-1895 at Kew. It includes generic names in alphabetical order between 1753-1885. International Plant Name Index (IPNI): Index Herbariorum: It is a guide to the location and contents of the worlds public herbaria. Floras: A flora is a systematic arrangement of the species of a given area or a particular region, usually restricted to a major segment of the plant kingdom (flowering plants etc.), with keys and descriptions and often illustrations, by the use of which a student may determine the names and characteristics of the wild plants of the area. In any flora the plants are arranged according to one or another of the available systems (Engler, Bessey, Hutchinson, etc.), giving for each plant the complete scientific name, author citation, reference to source of original publication, synonymy, and geographic distribution within the area in question. Monographs and Revisions: A monograph is a treatise including all significant information of a morphologic or taxonomic nature covering the group such as family or genus. A taxonomic monograph is a comprehensive treatise representing an analysis and synthesis of existing taxonomic knowledge of that taxon, plus the results of original research of that in systematics. In other words, it is as complete an account as can be made at a given time of any one family, tribe, or genus, nothing being neglected which is necessary for a perfect knowledge of it. A taxonomic revision differs from a monograph primarily in degree of scope and completeness. Often it accounts for only a section of a genus or for the elements as restricted to a continent or smaller geographical area. Many revisions make no attempt to review all previous work on the taxon or to take cognizance of the interrelated sciences of cytotaxonomy, genetics, ecology, etc. A revision may be based only on herbarium studies, where as monograph should cover the morphology, anatomy, cytology, genetics and ecology. Catalogues: Catalogues account for the books of special libraries rich in botanical titles, and are of especial value in taxonomic studies. It is often necessary to know the full name of a particular author, to know the unabridged and exact title of a work, to know when it was published, or when a particular edition was issued. These data are usually available from such catalogues. Review Serials: Review serials are periodicals, usually issued at regular intervals, that provide either: A bibliography of current literature of a particular subject, An abstract of papers or books in special fields, Reviews of titles of current literature, or Any combination of these functions. Periodical: A periodical, is a publication appearing usually at regular intervals. Each issue is called a number, or sometimes is termed a fascicle. Collectively these numbers or fascicles comprise a volume. In the case of periodicals appearing at regular intervals  biweekly, monthly, or quarterly- a volume usually comprises the issues of a calendar year. Dictionaries and Glossaries: Dictionaries and glossaries from the nucleus of taxonomic literature. Dictionaries and glossaries are invaluable in a subject matter with so large a vocabulary as that of Botany. A botanical dictionary may list and describe all known genera of certain plant groups e.g. A Dictionary of Flowering, Plants and Ferns by J. C. Willis. A glossary is an alphabetical list of difficult terms with their interpretations. 6.5.1 Important Contributions of Linnaeus Father of Taxonomy Binomial Nomenclature Artificial System of Classification Species Plantarum (1753): It was published in 2 volumes. First in May 1753 and second in August 1753. classification of 5,900 plants It does not provide generic description. Binomial system of nomenclature adopted in it for the first time. starting point for ICNafp [ICFRE 2020]. It accepted the rule of priority in the nomenclature of flowering plants and pteridophytes.

The Genera of Flowering Plants: It was published by J. Hutchinson is 2 volumes in 1964 and 1967; dealing with dicotyledonous plants. It is based on Genera Plantarum by Bentham and Hooker. Indian Publications: Flora of British India: J. D. Hooker Hortus Indicus Malabaricus (1678-1703): Published in 12 parts containing the account of 794 plants of Malabar region. It is Pre-linnean publication and first authentic record of plants. Wallichian catalogue (1828-1829): It is a list of 9,148 plants collected during Naithaniel Wallichis suprintendence of Royal Botanic Garden, Calcutta. Many new plant names proposed in this work are nomen-nudum, i.e., species names without description and contrary to rules of nomenclature. Botanical Survey of India published the Roxburgh Icones (1829) in small fascicles in 1964; Wights Icons contain 201 plates in 6 volumes. 6.6 Taxonomical Aids Herbarium: It is defined as a store house of collected plant specimens that are dried, pressed and preserved on sheets. These sheets are arranged in the sequence of an accepted classification system. Preservation of plants is done by drying and pressing technique. Steps of herbarium technique: Collection  Drying  Poisoning  Mounting  Stitching  Labelling  Deposition The collections are kept inside metallic vasculum or polythene bags. Poisoning is done by using 0.1% HgCl2 The international size of herbarium sheet is 41 × 29 cm Primary function of herbarium is accurate identification and -taxonomic research Greatest herbarium of world is herbarium of Royal Botanical Garden, Kew, England having more than 6 million specimens [CGPSC 2020] Largest herbarium of India  Central National Herbarium, Kolkata  20 lakh (2 million) specimens Herbarium making art was started by Caesalpino et. al. Taxonomic Keys: The scheme for identification of plants and animals is known as a key. These are based on the contrasting characters known as couplet. Each character of couplet is known as lead. Being analytical in nature, these are generally of two types: Indented or Yolked Key: It has sequence of choice between two or more statements of characters of species Bracketed Key: These are most popular keys, the pairs of contrasting characters are given numbers in brackets Botanical Gardens: Provide means of ex-situ conservation strategies and records of local flora for monographic work. Total 525 botanical gardens are established in various countries 125 botanical gardens are known with documented collections of authenticated taxa. The International Association of Botanical Gardens (IABG) was established in 1962. The International Directory of Botanical Gardens was published in 1983. Some Important Botanical Gardens are: Botanical Garden Remarks Royal Botanical Garden, Kew, England Botanical capital of the world; founded by William Aton Orto Botanico, Italy Oldest of world Pisa, Italy Famous for palaeontological study Palermo, Italy Famous for dragon plant Indian Botanical Gardens: Indian Botanical Garden, Kolkata Lloyd Botanical Garden, Darjeeling National Botanical Garden, Lucknow Lalbag Botanical Garden, Bangalore Museums: These have collections of preserved plants and animals for study and reference. These differs from parks because no living object is displayed in museums. E.g., Preservation of succulent plants  in FAA solution (2-5% Formaldehyde: Acetic acid: Alcohol in 5: 5: 90 ratio). Some important Museums: Natural History Museum, London (England) United States National Museum, Washington National Museum of Natural History (NMNH), Delhi Prince of Wales Museum, Mumbai Zoological Parks: Zoos/zoological gardens (parks) are protected areas or enclosed space where live wild animals are kept. Objectives are public exhibition to understand wild life, recreation, education, ex-situ conservation and breeding of rare fauna. National Zoological Park, Delhi is one of the finest zoos of Asia Largest zoo of the world in Kruger (South Africa) "],["references.html", "References", " References De Queiroz, Kevin. 2007.
